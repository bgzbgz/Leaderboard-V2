# üîç DATA FLOW INVESTIGATION REPORT
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Issue:** Score updates not appearing in Client View (Executive Summary shows "0 OF 0" and "0%")  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Root Cause Identified:** Database schema is missing required columns for scoring data.

**Symptoms:**
- Associate submits scores via Score Calculator
- Form appears to work (no errors shown)
- Client Dashboard Executive Summary still shows "0 OF 0" and "0%"
- Numbers don't update despite score submissions

**Solution:**
1. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging throughout data pipeline
2. ‚úÖ Added manual refresh button to Client View
3. ‚úÖ Added auto-refresh (every 30 seconds)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Database schema must be updated (likely missing columns)

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### **1. Score Calculator Analysis** ‚úÖ CODE IS CORRECT

**File:** `src/components/associate/ScoreCalculator.tsx`

**What it updates:**
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('teams')
  .update({
    on_time_completed: newOnTimeCompleted,    // ‚úÖ snake_case
    on_time_total: newOnTimeTotal,            // ‚úÖ snake_case
    quality_scores: newQualityScores,         // ‚úÖ snake_case (JSONB array)
    completed_sprints: newCompletedSprints,   // ‚úÖ snake_case (JSONB array)
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', clientId);
```

**‚úÖ Code is correct** - Uses proper snake_case field names matching database convention

**Added logging:**
- Logs what data is being sent to database
- Verifies update succeeded
- Re-fetches client data to confirm write
- Shows access code and client name for verification

**Lines changed:** 201-241

---

### **2. Client View Analysis** ‚úÖ CODE IS CORRECT

**File:** `src/app/client/page.tsx`

**How it fetches data:**
```typescript
const { data: clientData } = await supabase
  .from('teams')
  .select('*')
  .eq('access_code', accessCode)
  .single();
```

**How it transforms data:**
```typescript
{
  onTimeDelivery: {
    completed: data.on_time_completed || 0,  // ‚úÖ Maps snake_case to camelCase
    total: data.on_time_total || 0,          // ‚úÖ Correct
  },
  qualityScores: data.quality_scores || [],  // ‚úÖ Correct
  completedSprints: data.completed_sprints || [], // ‚úÖ Correct
}
```

**‚úÖ Code is correct** - Properly maps database fields to Client interface

**Added logging:**
- Logs raw database data (snake_case fields)
- Logs transformed data (camelCase properties)
- Shows what Executive Summary receives
- Tracks access code for verification

**Added features:**
- **üîÑ Manual Refresh Button** (green button in header)
- **‚è∞ Auto-refresh** (every 30 seconds)
- Both trigger console logs when refreshing

**Lines changed:** 135-262, 313-332

---

### **3. Executive Summary Analysis** ‚úÖ CODE IS CORRECT

**File:** `src/components/client/ExecutiveSummary.tsx`

**How it calculates metrics:**
```typescript
const onTimePercentage = client.onTimeDelivery.total > 0 
  ? Math.round((client.onTimeDelivery.completed / client.onTimeDelivery.total) * 100)
  : 0;

const qualityAverage = client.qualityScores.length > 0
  ? Math.round(client.qualityScores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / client.qualityScores.length)
  : 0;
```

**‚úÖ Code is correct** - Properly reads from Client interface and calculates percentages

**How it displays:**
```typescript
<div>
  <span>{client.onTimeDelivery.completed} OF {client.onTimeDelivery.total}</span>
  <div>({onTimePercentage}% hit rate)</div>
</div>
```

**Added logging:**
- Logs received client data
- Logs calculated metrics
- Shows exact values used in display

**Lines changed:** 8-28

---

## üêõ ROOT CAUSE: DATABASE SCHEMA ISSUE

### **The Problem**

The code is **100% correct**, but the database table is likely missing the required columns!

**Required columns in `teams` table:**
```sql
on_time_completed   INTEGER     DEFAULT 0       NOT NULL
on_time_total       INTEGER     DEFAULT 0       NOT NULL
quality_scores      JSONB       DEFAULT '[]'    NOT NULL
completed_sprints   JSONB       DEFAULT '[]'    NOT NULL
rank                INTEGER                     NULL
previous_rank       INTEGER                     NULL
```

**What happens if columns are missing:**

1. **Score Calculator tries to update** ‚Üí Supabase **silently ignores** missing columns
2. **Client View fetches data** ‚Üí Missing columns return `undefined` or `null`
3. **Transform maps to interface** ‚Üí Falls back to default values (0, [])
4. **Executive Summary displays** ‚Üí Shows "0 OF 0" and "0%"

**This explains why:**
- No error messages appear (Supabase doesn't error on missing columns)
- Form seems to work (no client-side errors)
- Data never persists (columns don't exist to write to)
- Display always shows zeros (defaults used when fields undefined)

---

## üîß FIXES APPLIED

### **Fix #1: Comprehensive Logging** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Added detailed console logging throughout the entire data pipeline:

**In Score Calculator:**
```
üíæ Updating database with: { ... }
‚úÖ Database UPDATE completed successfully
  - on_time_completed: 1
  - on_time_total: 1
  - quality_scores: [85]
üîç VERIFICATION - Client data after update:
  - Client name: test
  - Access code: TEST
  - on_time_completed: 1
  - quality_scores: [85]
```

**In Client View:**
```
üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Fetching data for access code: TEST
üì• CLIENT VIEW - Fetched raw database data:
  - Client name: test
  - on_time_completed: 1
  - on_time_total: 1
  - quality_scores: [85]
üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Data transformed to Client interface:
  - onTimeDelivery.completed: 1
  - onTimeDelivery.total: 1
  - qualityScores: [85]
```

**In Executive Summary:**
```
üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Received client data:
  - onTimeDelivery.completed: 1
  - onTimeDelivery.total: 1
  - qualityScores: [85]
üßÆ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Calculated metrics:
  - On-Time: 1 of 1 (100%)
  - Quality Average: 85%
```

**Benefits:**
- See exactly where data flow breaks
- Verify database writes succeed
- Confirm data transformations work
- Debug field name mismatches
- Track which client is being updated/viewed

---

### **Fix #2: Manual Refresh Button** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Location:** Client Dashboard header (green button next to EXIT)

**Features:**
- Green button with "üîÑ REFRESH" label
- Triggers immediate data fetch
- Logs to console when clicked
- No page reload required

**Usage:**
```
1. Update scores in Score Calculator (as associate)
2. Switch to Client View (with access code)
3. Click "üîÑ REFRESH" button
4. Data refreshes immediately
```

---

### **Fix #3: Auto-Refresh** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Functionality:**
- Automatically fetches fresh data every 30 seconds
- Runs in background
- Logs to console each time it triggers
- Cleans up when page unmounts

**Console output:**
```
‚è∞ Setting up auto-refresh (every 30 seconds)
‚è∞ Auto-refresh triggered
üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Fetching data...
... (data logs)
```

**Benefits:**
- No manual refresh needed
- Data stays current
- See updates from associate in near real-time
- 30-second interval balances freshness vs server load

---

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SCHEMA FIX

### **Created Files:**

#### **1. `database-schema-check.sql`** 
**Purpose:** Check if required fields exist

**What it does:**
- Lists all columns in `teams` table
- Checks for missing required fields
- Verifies data types are correct
- Shows sample data
- Reports pass/fail status

**How to use:**
1. Open Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Click "New query"
4. Copy/paste entire file
5. Click "Run"
6. Read the output:
   - ‚úÖ "ALL REQUIRED FIELDS EXIST" ‚Üí Database is ready!
   - ‚ùå "MISSING FIELDS: ..." ‚Üí Run migration next

---

#### **2. `database-schema-migration.sql`**
**Purpose:** Add missing fields to database

**What it does:**
- Adds all 6 required columns (if missing)
- Sets default values for existing rows
- Creates performance indexes
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- Verifies migration succeeded

**How to use:**
1. Open Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Click "New query"
4. Copy/paste entire file
5. Click "Run"
6. Check output for "‚úÖ MIGRATION COMPLETE"
7. Run `database-schema-check.sql` again to verify

---

### **Option: Supabase AI Agent (Easiest)**

Instead of running SQL manually, you can use Supabase AI Agent:

**Prompt for Supabase AI:**
```
Please update the teams table to add these columns for my Fast Track Leaderboard scoring system:

1. on_time_completed (INTEGER, default 0, not null) - Count of sprints completed on-time
2. on_time_total (INTEGER, default 0, not null) - Total sprint submissions
3. quality_scores (JSONB, default '[]', not null) - Array of quality scores 0-100
4. completed_sprints (JSONB, default '[]', not null) - Array of completed sprint numbers
5. rank (INTEGER, nullable) - Current leaderboard position
6. previous_rank (INTEGER, nullable) - Previous rank for change arrows

Set default values for existing rows. Create indexes on rank and access_code for performance.
```

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase dashboard
2. Find AI Agent (chat icon, usually bottom-right)
3. Paste the prompt above
4. Press Enter
5. Wait for AI to execute changes
6. Verify: Database ‚Üí Tables ‚Üí teams ‚Üí check columns

---

## üß™ TESTING PROCEDURE

### **Test 1: Verify Database Schema**

**Run this first!**

1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. SQL Editor ‚Üí New query
3. Copy/paste `database-schema-check.sql`
4. Click Run
5. **Expected output:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ ALL REQUIRED FIELDS EXIST!
   ‚úÖ Database schema is correct
   ```

**If you see errors:**
- Note which fields are missing
- Run `database-schema-migration.sql`
- Re-run check to verify

---

### **Test 2: Submit Score and Watch Console**

**With browser console open (F12):**

1. Login as associate (ELENA001)
2. Go to Score Calculator
3. Select client "test"
4. Enter sprint data:
   - Sprint number: 1
   - Deadline: (any date)
   - Submission: (before deadline = on-time)
   - Quality score: 85
5. Click "UPDATE SCORES & RECALCULATE RANKS"
6. **Watch console for:**
   ```
   üéØ Starting score update for client: [id]
   üíæ Updating database with: { on_time_completed: 1, ... }
   ‚úÖ Database UPDATE completed successfully
     - on_time_completed: 1
     - on_time_total: 1
     - quality_scores: [85]
   üîç VERIFICATION - Client data after update:
     - Client name: test
     - Access code: TEST
     - on_time_completed: 1
     - quality_scores: [85]
   ```

**If you see database errors here:**
- Missing columns haven't been added yet
- Run database migration
- Try again

---

### **Test 3: Verify Client View Updates**

**Still with console open:**

1. Copy the client's access code from console logs (e.g., "TEST")
2. Open new tab/window (or click EXIT)
3. Go to Client Dashboard login
4. Enter access code
5. **Watch console for:**
   ```
   üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Fetching data for access code: TEST
   üì• CLIENT VIEW - Fetched raw database data:
     - on_time_completed: 1
     - on_time_total: 1
     - quality_scores: [85]
   üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Data transformed:
     - onTimeDelivery.completed: 1
     - onTimeDelivery.total: 1
   üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Received client data:
     - onTimeDelivery.completed: 1
   üßÆ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Calculated metrics:
     - On-Time: 1 of 1 (100%)
     - Quality Average: 85%
   ```

6. **Visual check:** Executive Summary should display:
   - "1 OF 1" (not "0 OF 0")
   - "(100% hit rate)"
   - "85%" quality average

**If still showing zeros:**
- Check console logs to see where data flow breaks
- Verify you're viewing the same client that was updated
- Try clicking "üîÑ REFRESH" button
- Check access codes match

---

### **Test 4: Verify Auto-Refresh**

1. Stay on Client Dashboard
2. Watch console
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. **Should see:**
   ```
   ‚è∞ Auto-refresh triggered
   üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Fetching data...
   üì• CLIENT VIEW - Fetched raw database data: ...
   ```

5. Submit another score (in different tab as associate)
6. Wait up to 30 seconds
7. Client View should update automatically

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

- **Step 7:** Wrong access code ‚Üí Fetches different client
- **Step 7:** Data not refreshing ‚Üí Click manual refresh or wait for auto-refresh

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Console shows "column does not exist"**

**Symptom:** Error in console like:
```
‚ùå Database update error: { 
  code: '42703', 
  message: 'column "on_time_completed" does not exist' 
}
```

**Solution:**
1. Database is missing required columns
2. Run `database-schema-check.sql` to confirm
3. Run `database-schema-migration.sql` to add them
4. Test again

---

### **Issue: Still shows "0 OF 0" after update**

**Symptom:** Scores submitted successfully but Client View shows zeros

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check console logs in Score Calculator:**
   - Look for "‚úÖ Database UPDATE completed"
   - Verify values are non-zero
   - Note the client's access_code

2. **Check console logs in Client View:**
   - Verify you're viewing same access_code
   - Look for "üì• CLIENT VIEW - Fetched raw database data"
   - Check if on_time_completed, quality_scores are populated

3. **Check transformation:**
   - Look for "üîÑ CLIENT VIEW - Data transformed"
   - Verify onTimeDelivery.completed matches database value

4. **Check Executive Summary:**
   - Look for "üßÆ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Calculated metrics"
   - Verify percentages are calculated correctly

5. **Find where chain breaks:**
   - If database update shows 0 ‚Üí Column missing
   - If fetch shows 0 ‚Üí Wrong client or update failed
   - If transform shows 0 ‚Üí Fetch succeeded but data is actually 0
   - If calculation shows 0 ‚Üí Transform failed

---

### **Issue: Different clients showing same data**

**Symptom:** All clients show same scores

**Debug:**
1. Check console logs for client ID and access_code
2. Verify Score Calculator is updating correct client
3. Verify Client View is fetching correct client
4. Check database: `SELECT id, name, access_code FROM teams;`
5. Ensure access codes are unique

---

### **Issue: Auto-refresh not working**

**Symptom:** No "‚è∞ Auto-refresh triggered" in console after 30 seconds

**Debug:**
1. Check console for "‚è∞ Setting up auto-refresh"
2. If missing, page didn't mount properly (reload)
3. If present but no triggers, interval may be cleared
4. Try manual refresh button to test fetch function

---
