## 📐 Formulas Implemented

### Speed Score
```
(on_time_completed / on_time_total) × 100

Color Coding:
≥ 80%  → Green
60-79% → Amber
< 60%  → Red
```

### Quality Score
```
Sum of all quality scores / Number of sprints

Color Coding:
≥ 80%  → Green
65-79% → Amber
< 65%  → Red
```

### Quality Trend
```
If last 3 avg - previous 3 avg > 5:  "↑ improving"
If last 3 avg - previous 3 avg < -5: "↓ declining"
Otherwise: null (stable)

Requires: 6+ completed sprints
```

### Combined Ranking Score
```
(Speed Score × 0.6) + (Quality Score × 0.4)

This determines leaderboard position
Higher combined score = Better rank
```

### Rank Change Arrows
```
current_rank < previous_rank  → ↑ (Green - improved)
current_rank > previous_rank  → ↓ (Red - declined)
current_rank = previous_rank  → → (Gray - stable)
no previous_rank              → null (new)
```
